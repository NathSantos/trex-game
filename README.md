# The Trex Game

Welcome to the T-Rex Game! ðŸ¦–ðŸŒŸ

This is a classic game developed as part of the Web Programming course at college. Inspired by the famous Chrome dinosaur game that appears when you're offline, this version has been created to explore fundamental concepts of web development, providing an exciting opportunity to learn and enhance skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
